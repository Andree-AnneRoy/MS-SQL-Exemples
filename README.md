# MS-SQL-Exemples
Multiple exercises in SQL to show different database knowledge

#1 - Shops.sql is just basic knowledge of table management.
      ***Note that at the end we drop CLIENTS table, don't actually do it if you want to reuse the database, since you'll have to recreate          it.

#2 - Shops2.sql - We are reusing the SHOP database to show how to extract data.
